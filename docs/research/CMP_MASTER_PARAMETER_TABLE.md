# CMP Master Parameter Table

> Purpose: provide one project-wide parameter reference. This file preserves historical parameter tables while also recording the post-Turn-02 validation plan and the latest Run-7 frozen/executed anchors.  
> This document does **not** replace `docs/RUN_SHEET.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `CMD_HUB.md`, or the individual Run records. If any value or status conflicts, the latest `RUN_SHEET.md` and `DECISIONS.md` take precedence.

The table is organized to match the course requirement to separate **Geometry / Process / Device·Material** parameters, identify **Fixed / Split** controls, and record the physical reason and project role of each parameter. R7 circuit/protocol values are kept explicitly separate because most are still pre-execution candidates.

## 1. Status Legend

| Status | Meaning in CMP |
|---|---|
| `Fixed` | Held constant within the relevant established comparison path |
| `Split` | Executed controlled variable with more than one formal value |
| `Candidate` | Pre-execution working value; not yet frozen by Run evidence |
| `Planned Split` | Intended pre-execution split; not yet an executed result |
| `Frozen` | Explicitly locked for the stated downstream Run/protocol by the current decisions/run sheet |
| `Derived` | Calculated or extracted metric rather than a direct TCAD input |
| `Reference-only` | Literature/example value retained for context or guardrail development, not calibrated CMP truth |
| `Conditional` | Activated only if a stated failure/gap requires it |

## 3. Process Parameters and TCAD Representation

MEB and the other process labels below describe the **physical-process origin of a geometry/material feature**. The current mainline is not a full process-flow simulation; the SDE structure represents the resulting device geometry and doping in a controlled simplified form.

| 3D saddle-fin process geometry | `3D-Sun-B0` reconstruction | Sun-et-al.-consistent 20 nm geometry | Validation anchor | baseline feedback + selected-point future | Literature-consistent reconstruction exists; not exact absolute calibration; dense DOE remains 2D |

## 8. Run-by-Run Parameter Evolution

## 9. Parameter-to-Performance Causal Map

```text
MEB_Depth
  -> gate-drain coupling / project-internal Cgd
  -> drain-side electric-field redistribution / E_wall,max
  -> NonlocalPath-sensitive terminal GIDL
  -> temperature-dependent leakage balance
  -> 1T1C storage-node current / charge loss
  -> VSN(t)
  -> retention metric
```

Only the chain through transistor-level leakage is directly verified through R6.5. The final `1T1C storage-node charge loss -> retention` portion is the purpose of R7-R9 and remains unverified until executed data exist.

## 10. Interpretation Guardrails

- `P2=48 nm` is a transistor-level electrostatic/GIDL **retention handoff candidate**, not a global/final/production optimum.
- `51 nm` is a low-current/background-sensitive boundary reference and is not promoted as the best design from its endpoint alone.
- `MEB_Depth` represents the resulting GateTop geometry; the physical metal etch-back process itself is not simulated.
- `ACExtract |c(g,d)|` is a project-internal coupling metric, not calibrated production Cov.
- NonlocalPath GIDL is a project-internal relative leakage metric.
- `E_wall,max` is a fixed-cut local metric, not global Emax.
- Run 6/6.5 temperatures are isothermal fixed-lattice-temperature simulations, not self-heating calculations.
- R7 pre-execution circuit values remain Candidate / Planned / Reference-only unless the R7 exit gate explicitly freezes them.
- No direct retention improvement, refresh reduction, robust process/design window, Dual-WF superiority, 3D behavior, or trap/LER/PBTI conclusion is claimed before the corresponding evidence exists.
