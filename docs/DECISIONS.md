# Decisions

Decision date: 2026-08-02

## D-001 — Baseline ID

- B0 is the nominal 36 nm MEB/gate-top-depth case.
- The 31/36/41 nm split is development-only.
- The split is not used as a performance-optimization result.

## D-002 — MEB Meaning

- The MEB name is retained in response to professor feedback.
- Run 0 does not simulate an actual etch process; it implements the resulting gate-top depth geometrically.
- Documentation distinguishes DBCAT/process MEB from this simplified geometrical representation.
- The code variable `MEB_Depth` remains unchanged.

## D-003 — Single-WF Scope

- The current mainline uses a single work function.
- Dual-WF will be considered at the Decision Gate after Run 4.
- No conclusion that Dual-WF is superior is made in advance.

## D-004 — Corner Rounding

- Run 0 uses a rectangular trench bottom.
- Rounded/fillet geometry is reserved for G1.
- It is activated only if high-drain/off-state ElectricField or BTBT peaks are corner-dominated.

## D-005 — Git Data Policy

- GitHub stores code, conditions, CSV, key evidence, and decisions.
- Local archives store TDR, PLT, and full logs.
- The manifest tracks local-only artifacts without requiring them to exist in Git.

## D-006 — Metric Policy

- Run 0 records no official Vth, SS, Ion, Ioff, Ion/Ioff, or DIBL metric.
- Metrics are generated only after Run 1 freezes bias and extraction definitions.

## D-007 — Cov/Retention Fallback

- If Cov AC extraction fails, evaluate a Q–V derivative method.
- If both methods fail, use Emax only as an intermediate explanatory indicator without a Cov predictor claim in the title.
- If MixedMode fails, reduce scope to a clearly labeled retention proxy; do not overstate it as direct `retention`.

Decision date: 2026-08-18

## D-008 — Run 1 Internal DC Protocol

- The project freezes an internal B0/P1 comparison protocol for DC metrics.
- Low drain bias: VD = 0.05 V.
- High drain bias: VD = 1.0 V.
- Gate sweep: VG = 0 to 1.5 V with a 5 mV requested output grid.
- Vth is extracted at |Id| = 1e-9 A using semilog interpolation.
- SS is fitted over 1e-14 <= |Id| <= 1e-10 A.
- Ion is |Id| at VG=1.5 V, VD=1.0 V.
- DIBL = (Vth_low - Vth_high) / 0.95.
- DC Ioff at VG=0, VD=1.0 is retained only as a BTBT-off numerical-floor-sensitive diagnostic and is not called GIDL.
- Currents remain raw simplified-2D terminal currents, not calibrated production-cell currents.
- Clarification: Run 1 froze the bias/output/extraction definitions, not a unique solver `VG_MaxStep`. Run 2 mesh convergence used `VG_MaxStep=0.010`; formal Run 4+ DC DOE tightened it to `0.005` without changing the metric definitions.

## D-009 — Run 2 Mesh-DC Selection

- Run 2 compared Coarse, Medium, and Fine-local meshes while B0 geometry and physics were fixed.
- Coarse: 1,456 points / 3,187 elements.
- Medium: 4,571 points / 9,657 elements.
- Fine-local: 4,993 points / 10,513 elements.
- Coarse showed material DC metric differences.
- Medium and Fine-local were numerically consistent under the frozen Run 1 DC protocol and retained E-field cut checks.
- `Mesh-DC = Medium` is selected for subsequent baseline simulations.
- This decision applies to the current DC protocol only; Run 3 must still validate physics-specific Mesh-GIDL stability.

## D-010 — Mesh-GIDL Selection

- `Mesh-DC = Medium / Mesh_Code 1` remains the DC mesh.
- `Mesh-GIDL = Mesh_Code 3` is selected as the physics-specific mesh for relative GIDL comparisons.
- Mesh_Code 3 keeps the Medium base and adds local refinement at `X=0.032–0.070 um`, `Y=0.112–0.133 um`, with max/min `1.0/0.25 nm` around the observed drain-side BTBT-sensitive region.
- Geometry, contacts, and doping are unchanged.
- The selection does not establish absolute BTBT mesh independence or calibrated absolute GIDL.

## D-011 — Internal GIDL Comparison Protocol

- The Run 4 nominal reference is `MEB=36 nm`, `Mesh-GIDL / Mesh_Code 3`, and `T=300 K`.
- Drain bias is `VD=1.2 V`.
- Gate sweep is `VG=0 to -0.7 V` with a 5 mV requested output grid.
- BTBT uses `Band2Band(Model=NonlocalPath)`.
- The primary internal leakage metric is `|Idrain|` at `VG=-0.7 V`.
- The B0 nominal reference is approximately `1.3778e-14 A` (`1.3777737e-14 A` in the final raw CSV).
- This is an internal relative simplified-2D metric, not a calibrated production-cell leakage value.
- The exact standalone final R3-D ON and OFF executed decks were not available for archival; the final raw CSVs are the source of truth for the frozen endpoint result.

## D-012 — G1 Review after Run 3

- G1 is reviewed and not activated.
- Rectangular B0 is retained for Run 4.
- Corner rounding remains available as a conditional sensitivity branch if later field or BTBT evidence becomes corner-dominated.

Decision date: 2026-08-19

## D-013 — Run 4 Formal MEB Screening

- The 31/36/41 nm MEB levels were freshly rerun in the formal Run 4 projects and are the first official MEB DOE data for this project.
- Earlier Run 0/1 31/36/41 nm cases remain development-only parameterization checks and are not reused as formal optimization evidence.
- Formal GIDL comparison uses `Mesh_Code=3`, `T=300 K`, `VD=1.2 V`, `VG=0 to -0.7 V`, 5 mV requested output spacing, and NonlocalPath BTBT ON.
- Formal DC guardrail comparison uses `Mesh_Code=1`, `VD=0.05/1.0 V`, `VG=0 to 1.5 V`, and `VG_MaxStep=0.005 V` with BTBT disabled.

## D-014 — Run 4 GIDL Direction

- The formal endpoint `|Idrain|` values at `VG=-0.7 V` are `1.9624468e-14 A`, `1.3777737e-14 A`, and `7.7683012e-15 A` for MEB 31, 36, and 41 nm respectively.
- Normalized to 36 nm, the values are `1.424361`, `1.000000`, and `0.563830`.
- Within the screened 31–41 nm range, deeper MEB reduces the project-internal GIDL metric.
- 41 nm is recorded as the lowest-GIDL screened boundary case, not a final/global optimum.
- These are raw simplified-2D internal comparison values, not calibrated production-cell leakage.

## D-015 — Run 4 DC Guardrail

- Under the frozen Run 1 extraction definitions, no material Vth/SS/Ion/DIBL penalty is resolved across 31–41 nm.
- The largest observed deviations relative to nominal are on the order of `0.024 mV` in Vth, `0.04 mV/dec` in SS, `0.027 mV/V` in DIBL, and `0.021%` in Ion.
- Run 4 therefore passes the coarse MEB screening gate without declaring a final optimum.
- Cov/Cgd, formal Emax, temperature, retention, refresh burden, and robust process-window claims remain outside the completed Run 4 scope.

Decision date: 2026-08-21

## D-016 — Run 5A Internal Cgd Protocol

- Sentaurus Device `ACCoupled` and `ACExtract` are used for the B0 four-terminal small-signal matrix.
- The primary project-internal coupling metric is `|c(g,d)|`; `|c(d,g)|` is retained as a reciprocity cross-check.
- Formal comparison bias is `T=300 K`, `VD=1.2 V`, `VG=-0.70 V`.
- Representative frequency is `1 MHz`.
- BTBT is disabled for the Cgd extraction branch.
- The nominal 36 nm reference is approximately `1.6829627524e-16`.
- The value is a raw AC matrix element for internal comparison, not calibrated production-cell Cov.

## D-017 — Run 5A Frequency and Mesh Validation

- Cgd at 100 kHz, 1 MHz, and 10 MHz is effectively invariant under the nominal GIDL-relevant bias.
- The 100 kHz–10 MHz variation is approximately `1.68e-7 %`.
- Mesh_Code 1 versus Mesh_Code 2 changes nominal `|Cgd|` by approximately `0.2665%`.
- `Mesh_Code=1 / Medium` is retained for the current Run 5 Cgd comparison path.
- No separate Mesh-Cgd refinement is activated.

## D-018 — Run 5B Formal Five-Level MEB Correlation

- The formal MEB set is expanded to `31 / 33.5 / 36 / 38.5 / 41 nm`.
- All five levels are rerun in the Cgd formal batch under the frozen Run 5A protocol.
- All five levels are run in the GIDL formal batch under the frozen Run 3/4 NonlocalPath protocol.
- The 31/36/41 nm GIDL endpoints reproduce the formal Run 4 values exactly.
- Across 31→41 nm, the project-internal Cgd metric decreases by approximately `17.15%` and the GIDL endpoint decreases by approximately `60.42%`.
- Five-point correlation coefficients are descriptive internal trend evidence only and are not causal proof.

## D-019 — Fixed Drain-Side Wall Field Metric

- Run 5 replaces automatic SVisual color-bar maxima with a reproducible fixed-cut metric.
- Quantity: `Abs(ElectricField-V)`.
- Source: final GIDL TDR at `VD=1.2 V`, `VG=-0.7 V`.
- Cutline: `Y=0.116 um`.
- Formal interval: `X=0.032–0.070 um`.
- Metric: `E_wall,max`, the maximum field within that interval.
- `E_wall,max` is not called global Emax.
- All five formal peak positions remain inside the fixed interval and the peak value decreases monotonically with MEB.

## D-020 — Provisional P1 Selection after Run 5

- `P1 = 41 nm` is selected for the temperature stage as the provisional low-GIDL screened-window candidate.
- Within the tested 31–41 nm window, 41 nm has the lowest project-internal Cgd, E_wall,max, and GIDL values.
- No material Vth/SS/Ion/DIBL penalty is resolved at the current internal metric resolution.
- `P1=41 nm` is not a global, final, or production optimum.
- Temperature dependence, retention, refresh burden, and variation-aware process-window claims remain future work.

Decision date: 2026-08-21

## D-021 — Run 6 Elevated-Temperature Protocol

- Run 6 uses fixed lattice temperatures `300 / 340 / 380 K`.
- The Run 5 geometry, mesh standards, bias definitions, and base physics are retained.
- R6A changes the GIDL deck only by replacing fixed `Temperature=300` with `Temperature=@Temp_K@`.
- Run 6 is an isothermal device robustness comparison and does not simulate electrothermal self-heating or heat transport.
- Temperature values are project comparison conditions and are not claimed as universal AI-memory operating temperatures.

## D-022 — R6A Temperature-Dependent GIDL

- Formal MEB cases are `31 / 36 / 41 nm`.
- `Mesh_Code=3`, `VD=1.2 V`, `VG=0 to -0.7 V`, and NonlocalPath ON remain unchanged.
- All three 300 K endpoints reproduce the formal Run 5 values exactly.
- The total-current ranking remains `31 > 36 > 41 nm` at 300, 340, and 380 K.
- P1=41 nm reduces the endpoint relative to B0=36 nm by approximately `43.62%`, `44.25%`, and `16.91%` at 300, 340, and 380 K respectively.

## D-023 — R6B BTBT-OFF Background Control

- R6B compares B0=36 nm and P1=41 nm at 300/340/380 K with the same geometry, mesh, bias, and base physics as R6A but with NonlocalPath removed.
- The BTBT-OFF endpoint is only about `3.21%` of the 36 nm ON endpoint and `4.23%` of the 41 nm ON endpoint at 340 K.
- At 380 K the corresponding fractions increase to approximately `62.49%` and `75.38%`.
- This supports a large change in the total-current leakage balance at 380 K.
- R6B is a BTBT-off background reference under frozen project physics; it is not a complete physical decomposition of every thermal leakage mechanism.
- A single signed ON−OFF excess metric is not promoted across all temperatures because the 300 K OFF terminal-current polarity differs from the ON endpoint.
- Same-sign ON−OFF diagnostics at 340/380 K are retained only as project-internal supporting evidence and are not called calibrated pure-BTBT current.

## D-024 — R6C DC Thermal Guardrail

- R6C evaluates B0=36 nm and P1=41 nm at 340/380 K using `Mesh_Code=1`, `VD=0.05/1.0 V`, `VG=0 to 1.5 V`, `VG_MaxStep=0.005 V`, and BTBT OFF.
- Formal 300 K DC values are reused from Run 4/5 under the same extraction definitions.
- Temperature materially shifts Vth, SS, Ion, and DIBL, but 36 and 41 nm show nearly identical thermal changes.
- No material additional thermal DC penalty attributable to P1=41 nm is resolved.
- The 380 K SS fit shows reduced linearity (`R²≈0.9923`) relative to 340 K but remains usable for the internal trend comparison.

## D-025 — Run 6 Temperature-Dependent Fixed-Wall Field

- The Run 5 formal field definition is reused without change: `Abs(ElectricField-V)`, `Y=0.116 um`, `X=0.032–0.070 um`, final GIDL ON state at `VD=1.2 V`, `VG=-0.7 V`.
- The metric remains `E_wall,max`, not global Emax.
- Run 6 300 K field values reproduce Run 5 exactly.
- From 300 to 380 K, `E_wall,max` decreases slightly by about `0.89%` for 36 nm and `0.92%` for 41 nm.
- The 41 nm fixed-wall field remains approximately `1.24–1.27%` below 36 nm across 300–380 K.
- All formal peak positions remain inside the predefined ROI.

## D-026 — Run 6 Candidate Handoff

- `P1 = 41 nm` remains the provisional candidate entering Run 7 retention feasibility.
- The reason is the retained lowest total GIDL ranking, preserved fixed-wall field advantage, and absence of a resolved additional DC thermal penalty.
- The total-current advantage weakens at 380 K because a large BTBT-OFF background contribution is present.
- Run 6 does not establish retention time, refresh reduction, a full 3D result, or a global/final/production optimum.

Decision date: 2026-08-23

## D-027 — R6.5 Extended-MEB Boundary Closure

- Run 6.5 is inserted between Run 6 and Run 7 because P1=41 nm was the previous MEB sweep boundary.
- The extended set is `43/45/47/48/49/51 nm`, with 36/41 nm retained as reproduction/reference points.
- The purpose is to remove search-boundary ambiguity before retention complexity is introduced.
- R6.5 does not simulate the physical MEB etch process; MEB remains a geometric GateTop parameter.

## D-028 — GateTop/Junction Boundary and Lproj

- `Jdepth=48 nm` remains fixed.
- `Lproj=max(Jdepth-MEB,0)` is retained only as a gate–drain depth-projection helper.
- `Lproj` is not a physical lateral overlap length.
- At MEB=48 nm, GateTop≈Jdepth in the simplified 2D geometry.
- The 48 nm condition is a model-internal structural boundary, not a production-process optimum.

## D-029 — Extended Cgd and Fixed-Wall Field

- The project-internal `|c(g,d)|` decreases monotonically through 51 nm.
- The formal `E_wall,max` at `Y=0.116 um`, `X=0.032–0.070 um` also decreases monotonically through 51 nm.
- Therefore neither Cgd nor the formal wall field is considered saturated at 48 nm.
- The field-peak X position shifts deeper with increasing MEB.
- Automatic SVisual color-bar maxima are not formal cross-case metrics.

## D-030 — Extended GIDL and 51 nm Confidence

- Stable terminal GIDL reduction is observed through the 47–49 nm region.
- The 47→48 and 48→49 300 K endpoint improvements are small compared with earlier steps.
- The isolated 51 nm endpoint enters a low-current/background-sensitive regime and is not used to claim an optimum.
- BTBT-OFF remains a diagnostic background reference; ON−OFF is not called calibrated pure-BTBT current.

## D-031 — P2 Selection

- P1=41 nm is preserved as the historical initial screened-window candidate.
- P2=48 nm is selected as the extended-MEB structural-boundary knee candidate for retention handoff.
- 48 nm is not selected because it has the minimum Cgd, Ewall, or current.
- Selection is based on strong GIDL suppression, entry into the stable 47–49 nm low-current region,
  no resolved material DC/thermal-DC penalty, clear 300 K ON/OFF separation, and GateTop≈Jdepth interpretability.
- 49 nm is retained as the primary challenger/sensitivity point because it shows slightly lower 300 K
  Cgd/Ewall/GIDL and a favorable 340 K endpoint.
- P2 is not a global/final/production/process/3D optimum.

## D-032 — R6.5 High-Temperature Interpretation

- 48/49 nm retain a formal fixed-wall field advantage through 300/340/380 K.
- At 380 K, BTBT-OFF background fractions are approximately `91.5%` and `94.2%` for 48 and 49 nm.
- The compressed 48/49 total-current separation at 380 K is interpreted as background-dominated observability,
  not collapse of the formal hotspot field.
- No material distinguishing thermal-DC penalty is resolved between 48 and 49 nm.

## D-033 — R6.5 Archive and R7 Handoff

- The full R6/R6.5 SWB archive is `CMP_R65_FULL_BACKUP_20260823.tar.gz`.
- SHA-256 is `a057b444167a2c1b4cb302fbe2d43b03864a186a445543a251136d6e90a4ce19`.
- The raw binary archive remains local/external by default and is not committed.
- Run 7 retention feasibility uses B0=36 nm, P1=41 nm, and P2=48 nm.
- 49 nm is an optional challenger if one additional retention sensitivity point is affordable.

Decision date: 2026-08-27

## D-034 — Post-R6.5 Research Direction Reframing

- R0–R6.5 transistor-level results and historical interpretations remain unchanged.
- The post-R6.5 mainline is reframed from a pre-declared robust-process-window target to **transistor-to-cell retention translation**.
- The central question is whether MEB-induced reductions in project-internal Cgd, drain-side field, and GIDL translate into measurable 1T1C storage-node retention improvement.
- The current research title is updated to emphasize temperature-dependent translation of MEB-induced GIDL suppression into 1T1C retention.
- Refresh and robust-window claims remain downstream and conditional rather than pre-frozen outcomes.

## D-035 — P2 Cell-Level Validation Role

- `P1=41 nm` remains the historical initial screened-window candidate.
- `P2=48 nm` preserves its R6.5 structural/electrostatic handoff meaning.
- For R7+, P2 is explicitly classified as the **transistor-level electrostatic/GIDL candidate selected for cell-level retention validation**.
- `49 nm` remains the primary cell-level challenger/sensitivity point.
- No final/global/production/robust optimum is frozen before cell-level validation.
- The final interpretation may change if 49 nm or another retained comparator is favored by cell-level evidence.

## D-036 — Temperature-to-Retention Translation Mainline

- The 300/340/380 K Run 6/6.5 results remain isothermal transistor-level evidence.
- The strong growth of the BTBT-OFF/background contribution at 380 K motivates a cell-level question: whether the relative retention benefit of MEB-based GIDL suppression compresses as temperature increases.
- Run 7+ therefore treats temperature as a **translation stress variable**, not merely as a completed robustness label.
- `ON−OFF` is not treated as calibrated pure BTBT, and the exact dominant high-temperature leakage mechanism is not pre-assigned.

## D-037 — Revised R7+ Cell-Level Run Plan

- Run 7 freezes the 1T1C / retention simulation protocol using B0=36 nm at 300 K.
- Run 8 evaluates 300 K MEB-to-retention translation for 36/41/48 nm, with 49 nm optional as the primary challenger.
- Run 9 evaluates temperature-dependent retention translation; the minimum matrix is 36/48 nm at 300/380 K, with a preferred expanded matrix of 36/41/48/49 nm at 300/340/380 K.
- Run 9.5 is conditional and activates only if retention does not follow the transistor-level GIDL trend strongly enough to require alternate-leakage diagnosis.
- Run 10 is a local MEB sensitivity / optional robustness extension rather than a mandatory variation-aware design-window stage.

## D-038 — Robust-Design and Extended-Scope Deferral

- A robust process/design window is not a current completed or mandatory contribution.
- Robust-window wording may be promoted only after sufficient variation evidence and explicit pass/fail constraints exist.
- Refresh remains a downstream implication after a defensible retention metric is demonstrated.
- Distributed RWL/RC, PEB, Dual-WF, full 3D BCAT, explicit trap statistics, LER, PBTI, and Monte Carlo remain optional/future branches unless later evidence makes one of them necessary.
- The immediate mainline remains single-WF and focused on MEB → Cgd → field → GIDL → temperature-dependent leakage balance → 1T1C retention.

Decision date: 2026-08-30

## D-039 — Run 7 Scope and Measurement-Framework Role

- Run 7 is frozen as a **B0-only protocol/measurement-framework stage** using `MEB_Depth=36 nm` and `T=300 K`.
- Run 7 does not perform an MEB DOE and does not select a retention-effective MEB range.
- The Run 7 objective is to establish repeatable 2D-to-cell scaling, 1T1C MixedMode mapping, write, floating-SN hold, retention extraction, read charge sharing and numerical checks.
- Run 8 is the first cell-level MEB comparison: `36/41/48 nm` at 300 K with `49 nm` optional.
- This decision follows D-037 and supersedes the older Run 6/R6.5 handoff wording wherever that older wording could be read as placing B0/P1/P2 in the Run 7 protocol-freeze matrix itself.

## D-040 — Run 7 2D-to-Cell AreaFactor Strategy

- Sentaurus T-2022.03 documentation is used to define `AreaFactor` as a multiplier for device current/charge associated with the omitted dimension in 1D/2D simulation.
- The nominal Run 7 candidate is `AreaFactor=0.017`, corresponding to a 17 nm literature-derived saddle-fin-width proxy from the parent BCAT geometry.
- `0.011/0.017/0.023` are retained as a **one-time R7A sensitivity check** only.
- `AreaFactor=0.017` is not a production-calibrated electrical width and absolute retention values must be interpreted within that model assumption.
- After the R7A check, one AreaFactor is frozen and then held identical across R8/R9 so the MEB/temperature comparisons are not confounded by width scaling.

## D-041 — Run 7 1T1C Topology and Capacitance Baseline

- Run 7 maps the existing B0 contacts as `source -> BL`, `drain -> SN`, `gate -> WL`, and `substrate -> reference`.
- The `drain -> SN` mapping preserves the same drain-side region used in the R3-R6.5 GIDL analysis as the storage-node side of the cell-level study.
- `Ccell=10 fF` is adopted as the initial **project-internal 1T1C feasibility baseline**, supported by independent DRAM retention / Sentaurus-example precedents.
- `Ccell=10 fF` is not claimed as an exact production-cell capacitance.
- `CBL=45 fF` is retained only as a read-feasibility / charge-sharing reference candidate and is not a production-calibrated bitline capacitance.

## D-042 — Run 7 Write, Hold, and Read Guardrail Strategy

- Initial write screening uses `VBL_WRITE=1.2 V` as a candidate, `VWL_ON=1.5/2.0/2.5/3.0 V`, and `Twrite=10 ns` as the first timing candidate.
- The write-selection objective is the **minimum reasonable stable write condition**, not maximum `VSN` or maximum WL voltage.
- Because the prior formal CMP DC validation extended to `VG=1.5 V`, use of higher WL values in R7 is treated as a feasibility screen requiring numerical sanity rather than as an already validated operating specification.
- The primary hold candidate is `BL=0 V`, `VWL_HOLD=-0.7 V`, floating SN, and substrate reference at 0 V. The `-0.7 V` value is a **CMP GIDL-consistent retention-stress condition**, not a production DRAM standby-bias claim.
- Read validation is limited to BL/SN charge sharing and `DeltaVBL`; a full sense-amplifier model is outside Run 7.
- Cho et al.'s `0.698 V` read-derived threshold is retained as a literature reference only and is not frozen as a universal CMP/production threshold.

## D-043 — Run 7 Retention Metric and Direct/Integral Paths

- The primary common storage-node window for controlled retention comparison is `VSN=1.0 -> 0.8 V`, named `RT_1p0_0p8` in CMP.
- A common absolute window is preferred to a per-case `0.8 × VSN_write` threshold so that a write-performance penalty is not normalized away.
- The direct path is a floating-SN MixedMode transient that records `VSN(t)`.
- The long-time auxiliary path is a leakage-integral estimate from `Ileak(VSN)`:
  `RT_1p0_0p8,int = integral(Ccell / |Ileak(VSN)| dVSN)` over 0.8-1.0 V.
- Direct threshold-crossing time and the leakage-integral estimate remain separate quantities until consistency is demonstrated.
- The short-time overlap check compares direct `|dVSN/dt|` with `|I|/Ccell`; a large mismatch triggers a timestep/current-definition/floating-node audit rather than downstream interpretation.

## D-044 — Run 7 Physics, Mesh, and BTBT Attribution Continuity

- R7 preserves the existing CMP B0 device-physics chain: Fermi statistics, OldSlotboom, DopingDep/HighFieldSaturation/Enormal mobility, SRH(DopingDep), Auger, and `Band2Band(Model=NonlocalPath)` in the ON branch.
- Hurkx BTBT/SRH, quantum corrections, or example-specific mobility models from `SF_DRAM` are not imported merely because they appear in the Synopsys application example.
- `Mesh_Code=1` is used for smoke/write/read feasibility where appropriate; final retention/hold is rechecked with `Mesh_Code=3` to preserve the established drain-side Mesh-GIDL refinement.
- Project-internal numerical review targets before R7 close-out are approximately `<=1%` for `VSN_write`, `<=5%` for short-hold `DeltaVSN`, `<=10%` for integral retention, and `<=5%` for read `DeltaVBL` between the compared numerical settings.
- A one-time NonlocalPath ON/OFF retention comparison is required for attribution. The OFF branch is a background reference, not a complete leakage decomposition or calibrated pure-BTBT extraction.

## D-045 — Run 7 Exit Gate and Run 8 Handoff

- R7 cannot close until AreaFactor, topology, final write condition, floating-SN hold, `VSN(t)`, `Ileak(VSN)`, `RT_1p0_0p8`, read `DeltaVBL`, Mesh1/3 behavior, BTBT ON/OFF attribution and final-deck repeatability are all traceable.
- TDR/PLT/full solver logs remain local by default under D-005; GitHub keeps the source, parameter/evidence manifest, exported CSVs/processed summaries and selected images after execution.
- When R7 passes, the final AreaFactor, Ccell, terminal mapping, write/hold/read biases, timing, mesh, physics, retention metric and extraction rules are frozen for R8.
- R8 first changes `MEB_Depth` across `36/41/48 nm` with `49 nm` optional at 300 K.
- No retention improvement, refresh reduction, usable MEB range or robust process/design window is claimed before the corresponding executed Run evidence exists.

Decision date: 2026-09-22

## D-046 — Post-Turn-02 Three-Phase Validation Hierarchy

- The canonical research title remains **“20 nm급 BCAT DRAM에서 MEB 깊이에 따른 GIDL–Retention 전달 특성 및 온도 의존적 유효 설계 범위 도출.”**
- The main independent design variable remains **MEB depth**.
- The remaining study is organized as:
  1. single-WF MEB design-range derivation;
  2. temperature robustness / retention-translation validation;
  3. DWFG transferability validation.
- Temperature and gate scheme are validation axes; they do not replace MEB as the central research variable.
- A common SG/DWFG design range is only reported if the executed evidence produces a real overlap. Otherwise the result is reported as an MEB optimum/range shift under DWFG.

## D-047 — High-WL-Bias Write Feasibility Becomes a Guardrail

- The 300 K B0 write normalization condition `VWL_ON=3.0 V`, `VBL_WRITE=1.2 V`, `AreaFactor=0.017`, `Ccell=10 fF`, and `Twrite≈667 ns` is retained as an executed protocol checkpoint.
- Reaching `VSN≈1 V` is **not sufficient by itself** to declare write performance acceptable.
- The `3.0 V` WL requirement is promoted to an unresolved cell-performance guardrail.
- Future selected-point comparison should evaluate `VWL→VSN`, write time, and the relation to device/cell metrics before freezing the final effective MEB range.

## D-048 — Cold Temperature Extension

- Existing completed temperature evidence remains `300/340/380 K`.
- `233 K (-40 °C)` is added as a **planned** cold operating point.
- Until executed, no README, result table, or conclusion may imply a completed `233 K` result.
- The cold point is intended to test whether the SG-derived MEB candidate/range remains usable from cold to hot conditions.

## D-049 — DWFG Transferability, Not Baseline Replacement

- The 20 nm single-WF BCAT remains the baseline of record.
- The project does **not** replace the 20 nm baseline with the 15 nm ICEIC DWFG device.
- Jang & Kim (ICEIC 2026) is used as a literature mechanism/trade-off reference for MEB/DWFG interaction.
- After the SG MEB candidate/range is established, a DWFG extension will test the same candidate set for hotspot redistribution, GIDL, retention, and write/read transferability.
- Existing SG work remains the control/reference branch and is not discarded.

## D-050 — 3D Selected-Point Validation Strategy

- `3D-Sun-B0` remains the higher-fidelity validation anchor; it is not an exact calibrated reproduction of Sun et al.
- Dense design-space exploration remains in the controlled 2D framework.
- 3D is used on a small selected set after the candidate/range decision matures.
- A full `MEB × temperature × SG/DWFG` 3D factorial sweep is not part of the current mainline.
- For future DWFG 3D selected points, the BTBT hotspot must be re-located and the current mesh ROI revalidated; SG hotspot coordinates are not reused by assumption.
