# CMP Literature Notes Index

> `docs/REFERENCES.md` remains the bibliography/index of record; these notes record what CMP can and cannot reuse from each paper.

## REF ID Scheme

## Run 7 Implementation Source Set

The Run 7 preparation now has complementary sources rather than one paper that is expected to provide every value:

1. **REF08 Bang 2025** — published Sentaurus MixedMode 1T1C topology and storage-node transient precedent. Full PDF confirms the circuit connection but does not state the exact Ccell, pulse amplitudes/timing or retention threshold.
2. **Installed Sentaurus T-2022.03 `SF_DRAM` + MixedMode Training** — executable syntax precedent for `Device/System`, `Capacitor_pset`, `Vsource_pset`, `Set/Unset`, transient controls, 10 fF and leakage-integral retention; also includes a 45 fF BL-capacitor example.
3. **SDevice User Guide T-2022.03** — `AreaFactor` definition and 2D omitted-width current/charge scaling.
4. **REF06 Liu Part I** — common storage-node retention window, 10 fF precedent, multi-component leakage and statistical-tail scope boundary.
5. **REF09 Cho 2026** — 2D BCAT write/hold/read charge-sharing methodology, including the literature 10 ns/300 ms/0.698 V reference conditions.
6. **REF07 Liu Part II** — read/write/retention/PBTI trade-off warning and SC-WL field/geometry context; used to keep aging/RDF outside the nominal R7 mainline.
7. **REF05/REF03** — field/leakage/retention and MEB/GIDL novelty/trade-off context.

No paper-specific value is treated as production calibrated merely because it is reused as an R7 feasibility baseline.

## Note Discipline

Each paper note separates:

- PDF/primary-source facts;
- abstract-only facts where a PDF is still unavailable;
- CMP inference;
- reusable methodology vs non-transferable numbers;
- `Needs verification` items.

For Run 7 specifically:

- `Ccell=10 fF`, `AreaFactor=0.017`, write/read biases and the `1.0→0.8 V` metric must be documented as **CMP project-internal protocol choices with cited precedents**, not production calibration;
- Cho's `0.698 V` remains a literature reference unless CMP derives and freezes its own charge-sharing criterion;
- Bang's topology is reusable, but its missing circuit/timing values are supplied by installed-version Sentaurus precedents or explicit CMP choices rather than inference from plotted figures.
