## Role Rules

- `REF01-REF04`: baseline and current MEB/DWF novelty boundary.
- `REF05-REF09`: retention/cell-operation main group for R7-R10.
- `REF10-REF13`: variation/reliability/alternative-structure context.

Detailed extraction belongs in [`docs/literature/`](literature/README.md); this index should stay concise.

## Run 7 Source Status

The source gap that previously blocked a defensible R7 implementation review is now closed at the documentation level:

- **REF08 Bang 2025** full PDF reviewed: Sentaurus MixedMode 1T1C topology and storage-node transient precedent verified; exact circuit capacitance/pulse/retention threshold are not reported in the short paper.
- **REF06/REF07 Liu 2024 Part I/II** full PDFs reviewed: retention-window, multi-component leakage, temperature, weak-cell, PBTI/RDF and design-trade-off boundaries verified.
- **REF09 Cho 2026** full PDF reviewed: 2D BCAT write/hold/read-derived charge-sharing criterion verified.
- Installed **Sentaurus T-2022.03 `Memory/SF_DRAM`**, MixedMode training and SDevice `AreaFactor` documentation were directly audited for implementation syntax and 2D-to-circuit scaling.

No additional paper is mandatory before the first R7 B0 execution. Any later source request should be triggered by a specific convergence/interpretation gap rather than by general literature accumulation.

## Sentaurus Documentation

For Run 7 the installed-version evidence base includes:

- `Applications_Library/Memory/SF_DRAM/sdevice_mixedmode_des.cmd` — `Device/System`, 10 fF capacitor, `Set/Unset`, write transient;
- `Applications_Library/Memory/SF_DRAM/retention_des.cmd` + `Plot_RT_vis.tcl` — `I(VSC)` sweep and `C/|I|` retention integration;
- `Applications_Library/Memory/SF_DRAM/RH_des.cmd` — 10 fF SN + 45 fF BL-capacitor charge-sharing precedent;
- Sentaurus Training MixedMode sections — circuit coupling, transient solver and `TurningPoints`;
- SDevice User Guide T-2022.03 — `AreaFactor` current/charge scaling for omitted 1D/2D dimensions.

These are implementation precedents. CMP still preserves its own B0 geometry and established NonlocalPath physics unless a documented R7 failure requires a controlled change.
